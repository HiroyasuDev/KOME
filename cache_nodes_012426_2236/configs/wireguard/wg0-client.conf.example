# OKOME WireGuard client configuration (optional)
# Phase 5: Enterprise Hardening
# Use on admin workstation/laptop to connect to cache nodes
#
# Usage:
# 1. Generate client keys: wg genkey | tee client_privatekey | wg pubkey > client_publickey
# 2. Add client public key to server's [Peer] section
# 3. Configure this file with server public key and endpoint
# 4. Import into WireGuard client (wg-quick, GUI, etc.)

[Interface]
# Client private key
PrivateKey = YOUR_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Client VPN IP
Address = 10.0.0.2/24

# DNS (optional - use internal DNS if needed)
# DNS = 192.168.86.1

[Peer]
# Server public key
PublicKey = YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE

# Server endpoint (public IP or domain)
Endpoint = YOUR_SERVER_IP_OR_DOMAIN:51820

# Allowed IPs (routes traffic through VPN)
# Use 192.168.86.0/24 to access cache nodes, or 0.0.0.0/0 for full tunnel
AllowedIPs = 192.168.86.0/24

# Persistent keepalive (for NAT traversal)
PersistentKeepalive = 25
